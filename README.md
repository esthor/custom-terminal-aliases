Collection of my own terminal aliases

## Installation
### (RECOMMENDED) Install via oh-my-zsh
If you're not using [oh-my-zsh](https://github.com/robbyrussell/oh-my-zsh) for your terminal awesomeness, you probably should be.
1. Install [oh-my-zsh](https://github.com/robbyrussell/oh-my-zsh)
2. Copy the custom .zsh files you want the aliases from into your '~/.oh-my-zsh/custom' folder
3. Reload your terminal session (easiest: quit and reopen)
4. You should be good to go!

### Install via .profile
If you are using a .profile (or nothing at all) to manage your terminal profile and aliases.
1. Create or edit your '~/.profile' file to have the alias commands from the files you want.
2. Reload your terminal session (quit and reopen OR run `source ~/.profile`)
3. You should be good to go!
